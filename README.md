# clojureselect

Clojure Select stands as a powerful ally for HR professionals, integrating sophisticated algorithms to streamline decision-making. By offering insightful predictions and multi-criteria analysis, the system optimizes the candidate selection process. It serves as a valuable support tool, combining mathematical precision with human expertise to elevate decision-making in the dynamic landscape of HR.


## Components

The Clojure Select system has three core components that collectively support the HR sector in decision-making. Those components are: 
1. Decision Tree Algorithm 
2. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis Algorithms 
3. AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) Algorithm


## Examples

# Decision Tree Example

Let’s assume we have a certain training dataset. In Figure below, a portion of this data is shown. Complete training dataset contains information about 1018 former candidates. Note that all the data is of qualitative ordinal type.
